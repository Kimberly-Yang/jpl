If we do NOT include the "Notes" and "Letters" published in high impact factor journals (Eg, Nature, Science), then it will throw off the benchmarking curve. 
Since we ARE including items that are NOT peer reviewed, keep pubtype "Letters" and "Notes" such as News and Views published in Nature journal.
EXCLUDE Errata
EXCLUDE Editorial
In EndNote (AFTER importing Scopus export file) REMOVE items whose titles or other text indicate they are Intro, Preface, or Editorial).
