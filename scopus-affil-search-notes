Excluding articles pubtype "letters" such as News and Views published in Nature journal.
Kept "Notes" pubtypes because actual articls appear. However, some comments, intro/prefaces will be weeded after export.
In EndNote will delete: 
1. GAVRT: Learning science by doing science
2. An introduction to the special issue on Geoscience Papers of the Future

If we do not include the "Notes" and "Letters" published in high impact factor journals, then it will throw off the benchmarking curve.
